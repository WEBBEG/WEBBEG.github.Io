<p>This little sweetheart’s ear was almost completely torn off, and his cries in pain at the beginning of this video are hard to bear, but WATCH TIL THE END, because when little Banjo has healed he will remind you of all the reasons it feels so beautiful to help such vulnerable animals in an emergency.
You can bring huge relief…to someone small. </p>

            <h2>Dog hiding with terrible wound rescued</h2>
            <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rG30a3TO6II" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Although Jupiter, a street dog, was hiding underneath the stairs of a house of strangers, his trusting response to his rescuers made us wonder if on some level he was just waiting for help. His sorrowful eyes told us everything we needed to know about his pain. We hurried him back to the hospital and onto the treatment table where we discovered that the wound on his neck–probably a dog bite infested with maggots–was actually even bigger than we had suspected. Debriding the wound, flushing, removing maggots and wrapping it snuggly with padded bandages would be the first of many days of treatment. But Jupiter seemed to know he was on the path of healing from the first touch by the rescue team. Meet Jupiter after six weeks of wound care. He’s definitely a new boy–and an angel through and through. </p>

<h3>Dog saved after huge porcupine quill pierced into eye lid</h3>
<iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrAm7HUE9L0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This elderly girl was completely dazed and desperate when a kind man found her stumbling in pain. An enormous porcupine quill was embedded 3 inches into her forehead, piercing through her eye lid. It is astounding that the quill did not pierce into her eye, it was so incredibly close. We are so thankful to the man who called Animal Aid immediately for help, and to all of you who donate, volunteer and share our rescue videos, making it possible for us to help sweethearts like this who otherwise simply wouldn’t survive.</p>
