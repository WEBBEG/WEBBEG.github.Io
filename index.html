        <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
      <p>Our mission is to replace apathy and neglect with protection. And by building a request-response culture, Animal Aid is teaching the local community that it is deeply satisfying to help a suffering animal. Feeling –and really BEING—a part of saving the life of a street animal changes each of us. We become more eager to help the next, and more willing and able to imagine the suffering of the millions of animals we can save by preventing their suffering in all the choices we make with our lives.

By offering the community free-of-cost street animal rescue, we not only rescue hundreds of animals every month, but we create a vital moment of action: When a resident of Udaipur sees an animal who needs help, instead of ignoring that suffering and walking away, our rescue service encourages them to stop and help.

By providing a phone number someone can call and a shelter who will help and save, we are inspiring action. Action that though small at first, maybe just a phone call on our helpline, is the first step on the road of becoming an animal protector.

Our ultimate goal is equality and protection of all animals and a complete end to the use and abuse of animals. We are working for the day that every dog, donkey, cow, pig, fish and mouse can live their lives in freedom.</p>
 <h2>Who are the animals we rescue</h2>
 <p>Thousands of dogs, cows, donkeys and other animals live on the street in Udaipur alone, and millions across India. In the region where Animal Aid works in Udaipur, Rajasthan, the animal’s presence on the street is generally accepted, and feeding street animals is even a part of the culture. However, as traffic increases and the city expands, life can be a daily struggle for many animals on the street. Street dogs survive off of human left overs in India much as they have done for thousands of years (more than 10,000 years!) They find left-overs from restaurants and markets, and also enjoy food left especially for them by kind neighbors. There is a popular tradition in this region for the first and last chapatti (piece of bread) to be given to a cow and a dog.</p>
 <p>While some street dogs live in quiet colonies with little traffic, others live near busy intersections where they search for food from garbage dumps and risk their live simply crossing the street. Their population grows in relation to the availability of food.</p>
 <p>The life of a little family of puppies often goes like this: While there might have been adequate food from caring neighbors and a local garbage heap, a mother’s four growing puppies quickly discover mama’s milk is not nearly enough, but there’s nothing else to eat. Their mother gives everything she can to sustain them, but by the time they’re a couple of months old, she’s thin, growing thinner, and often dies of hunger. Often, all but one of the puppies dies too. The little survivor has lost every family member. There’s only enough food for the one—the one who used to be his mama.</p>
 <p>Puppies born onto the street are almost always destined to horrible deaths from primarily road accidents and lack of food.</p>
 <p>Cows and bulls become strays when they have been dumped on the street by Dairies because they are no longer productive (female cows who are no longer profitable and male calves soon after being born.) Because there are no grazing grounds in the city, the cows and bulls forage for food from garbage bins along with the dogs, however along with finding bits of food here and there, they consume enormous amounts of plastic, so much so that every cow who has been living on the street for more than a few months has dozens of kgs of plastic trapped in their stomach that they cannot digest. The consumption of plastic is fatal due to the toxicity of the plastic and other rubbish and because their stomachs become so full of plastic that they can no longer eat.
